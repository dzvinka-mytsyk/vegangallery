                  <h4>
                    Fist of all, <b>PEOPLE</b>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    When you work in IT you work with exceptionally smart people.
                    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
                        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> to get the interest in "all things technical" and to keep it going even for decades</li>
                        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> to endure years of Computer Sience education and continue active self-education for the length of etire career</li>
                        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> to grasp all those complex and abstract mathemathical and algorithmical concepts</li>
                        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> natural language processing,</li>
                        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> and still be able to turn arround and apply them to fix "down to earth" problems</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ... to do all that and more - you have to be smart.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Second: IT is not about <b>INTERPRETATIONS</b>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    In Polytology or Art, Economics or History you might find the "room for opinions or open interpretation based on nothing". But in most cases in IT stuff in truly descreet - things either work or not, compile or not, run or not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of cource, there are still places for "opinions", like during the refctoring or choosing the framework, but:
                    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
                      <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> people in IT much more often tend to settle those differences using descreet quantified methods. Which I think is again because guys and girls in IT are freaking smart.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Fewer <b>POLITICS</b>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Thanks to lack of interpretation, it always easier to make one's point based on obvious "stuff working or not".
                  </p>
