                      In order to lead - IT needs to communicate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For IT concerns to be heard and understood
                  Even in companies where IT actually brings the value - their voice gets lost while voice of other departments becomes ever so loud.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  That is not to say that quiet IT is more important than others. Rather sucessful company is a result of a harmony by all the parts being on the same page. When one of the parts (IT) is lost - harmony gets lost with it. The result id a distorted view of the "state of affairs".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, IT guys can and should fix it for themselves by themselves. At the end of the day, they are the smartest guys in the building.
